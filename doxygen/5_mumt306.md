# MUMT-306 project report

## Objectives

My original objective was to write a polyrhythmic metronome. As I started working on libmetro, the objectives became more concrete:

1. Write a library for building basic metronomes i.e. set a bpm for a sine wave click track. The cornerstone of libmetro is the use of a real-time audio library, <http://libsound.io/>. To use it effectively, I had to learn how to use ringbuffers and other techniques of real-time audio code.
2. Support additional timbres by using <https://github.com/thestk/stk> drum sounds. This is important when playing simultaneous rhythms (e.g. 4:3) to distinguish each rhythm by timbre.
3. Learn (some of) the theory behind rhythm and time signatures, and implement them alongside the basic click track e.g. polyrhythms, compound time.
4. Ensure the resulting code is easy to read and understand - don't let the ugly bits of C++ show too much.
5. Ensure the underlying code of the library is as correct and well-behaved as possible by testing and verifying the code using industry best practices. Users should only focus on whether or not their metronomes sound good, and not need to debug a segmentation fault, undefined behavior, or a memory leak.

## Methodology

### Real-time audio

The following articles are a good introduction to the challenges of real-time audio code:

* <http://www.rossbencina.com/code/real-time-audio-programming-101-time-waits-for-nothing>
* <http://atastypixel.com/blog/four-common-mistakes-in-audio-development/>

The code that's sending audio data directly to the sound device should not have any delays (e.g. network calls, waiting for mutexes, sleeps) to avoid the risk of glitchy audio or worse. Since a metronome is timer-based, I make use of sleeps heavily in the code. In practice, libmetro's timer-based note player is kept separate from the audio callback thread - the two components communicate with a [ringbuffer](https://libsoundio.dpldocs.info/soundio.soundio.SoundIoRingBuffer.html) - [source code here](https://github.com/sevagh/libmetro/blob/master/src/outstream.cpp#L107).

I've recorded a clip of a polyrhythm played at an impractically high 1900bpm (31.58ms period) by libmetro. This should demonstrate that my timing assumptions and ringbuffer fill/drain strategy are working correctly at very low latencies:

\htmlonly
<audio controls="1">
  <source src="./static/poly_352_1900bpm.wav"
          type="audio/wav">
  </source>
</audio>
\endhtmlonly

### Evolution of libmetro's UX

#### V0: too much C++

The first version of the UX exposed too much "wiring", e.g. requiring the users to write [lambda functions](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/lambda) to create a metronome. Original 4/4 drum track:

```
int bpm = std::stoi(argv[1]);
auto tempo = metro::Tempo(bpm);

auto audio_engine = metro::audio::Engine();
auto stream = audio_engine.new_outstream(tempo.period_us);

auto hihat = metro::timbre::Drum(42, 100);
auto snare = metro::timbre::Drum(38, 100);
auto bass = metro::timbre::Drum(45, 100);

metro::Measure beat22(std::vector<metro::QuarterNote>({
    [&]() {
        stream.play_timbres({&hihat, &snare});
    },
    [&]() { stream.play_timbres({&hihat}); },
    [&]() {
        stream.play_timbres({&hihat, &bass});
    },
    [&]() { stream.play_timbres({&hihat}); },
}));

tempo.register_measure(beat22);
tempo.start();

audio_engine.eventloop();
```

The lambda syntax (i.e. `[&]() { }`) is new to C++ in the 2011 standard, so making it a necessary part of libmetro's UX was a bad decision.

#### V1: too much music

After learning a (very little) bit about time signatures (mostly from YouTube tutorials or asking classmates and friends), I went too far. I created a notion of "note durations", defined an enum with the values Whole, Half, HalfTriplet, Quarter, QuarterTriplet, Eighth, EighthTriplet, Sixteenth, SixteenthTriplet, each with a separate bpm computed from the input bpm (expected to be the quarter note bpm).

My first 3:2 polyrhythm is one where I threw together 3 "QuarterTriplet" notes and 2 "Quarter" notes and expected things to Just Work. This is what it sounded like:

\htmlonly
<audio controls="1">
  <source src="./static/bad_poly32.wav"
          type="audio/wav">
  </source>
</audio>
\endhtmlonly

This is what the code looked like:

```
auto metronome = metro::Metronome(bpm);

auto poly1 = metro::Measure(2);
poly1[0] = metro::Note(metro::Note::Timbre::Drum, 185.0, 100.0)
           + metro::Note(metro::Note::Timbre::Drum, 207.65, 100.0);
poly1[1] = metro::Note(metro::Note::Timbre::Drum, 207.65, 50.0);

metronome.add_measure(metro::Measure::NoteLength::Quarter, poly1);

auto poly2 = metro::Measure(3);
poly2[0] = metro::Note(metro::Note::Timbre::Drum, 73.42, 100.0)
           + metro::Note(metro::Note::Timbre::Drum, 92.50, 100.0);
poly2[1] = metro::Note(metro::Note::Timbre::Drum, 73.42, 50.0);
poly2[2] = metro::Note(metro::Note::Timbre::Drum, 73.42, 50.0);

metronome.add_measure(
    metro::Measure::NoteLength::QuarterTriplet, poly2);
metronome.start_and_loop();
```

Contrast with a correct 3:2:

\htmlonly
<audio controls="1">
  <source src="./static/good_poly32.wav"
          type="audio/wav">
  </source>
</audio>
\endhtmlonly

I realized that baking in my incomplete knowledge of music could create a dangerously incorrect library. Note that this is the same rationale for why I don't have any examples that automatically create metronomes based on input time signatures (I put in many, and removed them). Somebody with a better grasp on time signatures could create a better frontend for libmetro that does that.

#### V2: just right

The final UX of libmetro is more "automated manual" than fully-automatic-but-incorrect as in V1. When following YouTube tutorials on how one should create a 3:2 or 4:3 polyrhythm by considering the least common multiple, I reverted to exposing a single timer, and expect that the user should lay the beats out in a measure.

This led to the simplest code, and the best sounding metronomes.

```
auto metronome = metro::Metronome(100);

// lcm of 3 and 4 is 12
auto measure = metro::Measure(12);

measure[0] = downbeat1 + downbeat2;  // <----- 1/4, 1/3

measure[3] = weakbeat1;              // <----- 2/4
measure[6] = weakbeat1;              // <----- 3/4
measure[9] = weakbeat1;              // <----- 4/4

measure[4] = weakbeat2;              // <----- 2/3
measure[8] = weakbeat2;              // <----- 3/3

metronome.add_measure(measure);
metronome.start_and_loop();
```

#### V3: the experimental text file format

I thought that the above example (V2) could be easily expressed in a text file, eliminating the need for users to write code at all. This is what it looks like:

```
measure_length 12

# [-------- downbeat1 -----------]+[--------- downbeat2 ------------]
0 drum,73.42,100.0 drum,92.5,100.0 drum,207.65,100.0 drum,185.0,100.0

# [- weakbeat1 -]
3 drum,73.42,50.0

# [- weakbeat2 -]
4 drum,207.65,50.0

# [- weakbeat1 -]
6 drum,73.42,50.0

# [- weakbeat2 -]
8 drum,207.65,50.0

# [- weakbeat1 -]
9 drum,73.42,50.0
```

I also received a suggestion from Victor for an improved file format that's more intuitive:

```
1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
```

You can read more about these formats [in this doc](./md__home_sevagh_repos_libmetro_doxygen_2_txt_file_format.html). 

## Tests and code quality tools

### Unit tests

The most critical aspect of a metronome is having an accurate timer. A naive ticker implementation is as follows:

```
int bpm = 100;

auto period_us = std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::microseconds>(
	    std::chrono::duration<double, std::micro>(
	        1000000.0 * (60.0 / bpm)));

// 100bpm period is 600,000 microseconds i.e. tick every 0.6s

while (true) {
        // insert code to play a click
        std::this_thread::sleep_for(period_us);
    }
}
```

The documentation for [`std::this_thread::sleep_for`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/sleep_for) says:

>>>Blocks the execution of the current thread for _at least_ the specified sleep_duration. This function may block for longer than sleep_duration due to scheduling or resource contention delays.

Writing a unit test to measure the clock accuracy led me to discover how badly the naive ticker was drifting, and led to the creation of a more precise timer:

```
void precise_sleep_us(std::chrono::microseconds dur_us)
{
        auto start_tick = std::chrono::steady_clock::now();
        while (std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::microseconds>(
                   std::chrono::steady_clock::now() - start_tick)
               < dur_us)
                std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::nanoseconds(1));
}
```

This might be familiar from the first exam - it's better to sleep in tiny amounts (since sleeping is non-premptible) to exercise finer-grained control over execution times. Here's an example of a naive ticker vs precise ticker, playing a 4-note measure that consists of 1 beep and 3 silences, at 500, 700, and 900bpm. Notice the out-of-sync beeps - that's the naive clock drifting away from the expected bpm:

\htmlonly
<audio controls="1">
  <source src="./static/ticker_vs_ticker.wav"
          type="audio/wav">
  </source>
</audio>
\endhtmlonly

The clock accuracy unit test verifies that the precise sleep stays within 2% clock drift (i.e. it ticks when it's expected to, +-2% at most). Of course, this is hardware and platform-dependent, but it's better than the naive clock.

### Undefined behavior, ubsan, asan

Recall this from the class notes:

```
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
  std::vector<unsigned char> bytes(2); //2-element vector
  bytes[3] = 79;     // ERROR: attempt to write a value to the 4th element, which doesn't exist!!!
  std::cout << "hello, world!" << std::endl;
}
```

This doesn't create any errors in C++ using g++ or clang++ on my laptop (Fedora 30, Thinkpad T490):

```
sevagh:ub-test $ g++ undefined_behavior.cpp
sevagh:ub-test $ ./a.out
hello, world!
sevagh:ub-test $ clang++ undefined_behavior.cpp
sevagh:ub-test $ ./a.out
hello, world!
```

Why? This is [undefined behavior](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/ub#Access_out_of_bounds). How are ways we can detect this? I know of two - [valgrind](http://valgrind.org/) and [asan](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/AddressSanitizer.html).

Let's see valgrind in action. Code running under valgrind is slower, since valgrind executes lots of extra code for error instrumentation:

```

How about `asan`? To use asan, one must compile the code with special flags (initially implemented in clang, but now available in [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Instrumentation-Options.html)):

```

Finally, [here's an article](https://lemire.me/blog/2016/04/20/no-more-leaks-with-sanitize-flags-in-gcc-and-clang/) (from a highly respected computer science professor) advising the use of `-fsanitize=address` and `-fsanitize=unknown`, both of which I use in libmetro (target: `make build-ubsan`) to try to detect bugs.

### Other quality tools

The target for [clang-tidy](https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/) in libmetro is `make build-clang-tidy` (clang-tidy needs to run at compile time). clang-tidy and cppclean mostly provide suggestions for code clarity:

```
/home/sevagh/repos/libmetro/build/../src/outstream.cpp:46:7: warning: implicit conversion 'struct SoundIoRingBuffer *' -> bool [readability-implicit-bool-conversion]
        if (!ringbuf)
```

This might be a common idiom but it's not as explicit as `if (ringbuf != nullptr)`. [nullptr in C++11](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/nullptr) is a safer version of `NULL`.

Likewise, [cppclean](https://pypi.org/project/cppclean/) (`make cpp-clean`) lets us avoid a few redundant header includes:

```
/home/sevagh/repos/libmetro/src/metronome.cpp:2: 'outstream.h' already #included in '/home/sevagh/repos/libmetro/src/metronome.h'
```

[clang-analyze](https://clang-analyzer.llvm.org/) (`make clang-analyze`) runs the entire cmake/ninja compilations under the `scanbuild` command:

```
[5/16] Building CXX object CMakeFiles/metro.dir/src/timbregen.cpp.o
../src/timbregen.cpp:106:2: warning: 2nd function call argument is an uninitialized value
        populate_frames(frames, timbre, freq, vol);
        ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
../src/timbregen.cpp:106:2: warning: 3rd function call argument is an uninitialized value
        populate_frames(frames, timbre, freq, vol);
        ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
../src/timbregen.cpp:106:2: warning: 4th function call argument is an uninitialized value
        populate_frames(frames, timbre, freq, vol);
        ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
```

The problem in the code is in the text file format parser:

```
metro::Note::Timbre timbre;
float freq;
float vol;

// logic to parse the text file and extract values of timbre, freq, vol

populate_frames(frames, timbre, freq, vol);
```

The problem is that if the parsing logic never reaches the code that sets those variables (entirely possible - pass it a blank file, an invalid file, etc.), those values are used uninitialized, and uninitialized values in C++ have [unpredictable values](https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/display/c/EXP33-C.+Do+not+read+uninitialized+memory) - it's that undefined behavior again.

Let's see it in a minimal example:

```
#include <iostream>

class Airplane {
public:
        void set_cruising_altitude(float altitude) {
                std::cout << "Setting airplane altitude to: " << altitude << std::endl;
        }
};

class Autopilot {
public:
        Autopilot(int knots) : knots(knots) { };
        float get_cruising_altitude() {
                return cruising_altitude;
        }
private:
        int knots;
        float cruising_altitude;
};

int main()
{
        auto plane = Airplane();

        int desired_knots = 60;
        auto autopilot = Autopilot(desired_knots);

        plane.set_cruising_altitude(autopilot.get_cruising_altitude());

        return 0;
}
```

I chose ridiculously names in the example to make a somewhat serious point that bad C/C++ code is a real issue in safety-critical applications. In action:

```
sevagh:ub-test $ ./a.out
Setting airplane altitude to: 4.59121e-41
```

### 2. Complex examples

There are programs included in libmetro, where I attempt to implement a variety of useful metronomes inspired by the [Bounce Metronome](https://bouncemetronome.com/) collection.

**N.B.** I was unaware of the existence of Bounce Metronome when I started libmetro. All of my code is written from scratch, with no influence from Bounce Metronome (which is closed-source anyway). However, it's an excellent resource of complex rhythms, and I shamelessly duplicated the Bounce Metronome audio clips as a demonstration of libmetro's capabilities.
